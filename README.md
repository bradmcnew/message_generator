# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

I'm a HUGE Celtics fan and I was prompted to make a random message generator so I decided to do one on the 2024 NBA Finals.
This project is a fun (but likely innacurate) prediction model of the 2024 NBA Finals.
I learned how to implement my JavaScript skills, Markdown skills, and how to use version control with git and Github.

## Installation

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bradmcnew/message_generator.git

## Usage

To use, simply enter node script.js and the simulator will be run.

## Credits

I used NBA2k24 Player Ratings: https://www.2kratings.com/teams/ to help with my simulation.
